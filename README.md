 - Write a Python program to find those numbers which are divisible by 7 and multiple of 5, between 1500 and 2700 (both included).

 - Write a Python program to convert temperatures to and from Celsius, Fahrenheit.
	```[ Formula : c/5 = f-32/9 [ where c = temperature in Celsius and f = temperature in Fahrenheit ]
	Expected Output :
	60°C is 140 in Fahrenheit
	45°F is 7 in Celsius```
 - Write a Python program to guess a number between 1 to 9.
Note : User is prompted to enter a guess. If the user guesses wrong then the prompt appears again until the guess is correct, on successful guess, user will get a "Well guessed!" message, and the program will exit.

 - Write a Python program that accepts a word from the user and reverse it.

 - Write a Python program to count the number of even and odd numbers from a series of numbers.
	```
	Sample numbers : numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
	Expected Output :
	Number of even numbers : 5
	Number of odd numbers : 4```
 - Write a Python program that prints each item and its corresponding type from the following list.
	```
	Sample List : datalist = [1452, 11.23, 1+2j, True,'w3resource', (0, -1), [5, 12],{"class":'V', "section":'A'}]
	```

 - Write a Python program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 and 6.
	```Note : Use 'continue' statement.
	Expected Output : 0 1 2 4 5
	```
 - Write a Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 to 50.
	```	Note : The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers :
	0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ....
	Every next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.
	Expected Output : 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 
	```
 - Write a Python program which iterates the integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
	```
	Sample Output :	
	fizzbuzz
	1
	2
	fizz
	4
	buzz
	```
 - Write a Python program which takes two digits m (row) and n (column) as input and generates a two-dimensional array. The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j.
	```
	Note :
	i = 0,1.., m-1
	j = 0,1, n-1.
	Test Data : Rows = 3, Columns = 4
	Expected Result : [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3], [0, 2, 4, 6]]
	```
 - Write a Python program that accepts a sequence of lines (blank line to terminate) as input and prints the lines as output (all characters in lower case).

 - Write a Python program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers as its input and print the numbers that are divisible by 5 in a comma separated sequence.
	```
	Sample Data : 0100,0011,1010,1001,1100,1001
	Expected Output : 1010
	```
  

 - Write a Python program that accepts a string and calculate the number of digits and letters.
	```
	Sample Data : Python 3.2
	Expected Output :
	Letters 6
	Digits 2
	```

 - Write a Python program to check the validity ofpassword input by users.
	```
	Validation :
	 - At least 1 letter between [a-z] and 1 letter between [A-Z].
	 - At least 1 number between [0-9].
	 - At least 1 character from [$#@].
	 - Minimum length 6 characters.
	 - Maximum length 16 characters.
	```
